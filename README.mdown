tvOS Browser
=============

Web browser for tvOS using private API (aka UIWebView).
You'll need to redefine the following in Availability.h to build successfully.
```
Availability.h for the AppleTV is located in Xcode>Contents>Developer>Platforms>AppleTVOS.platform>Developer>SDKs>AppleTVOS.sdk>usr>include
Availability.h for the AppleTV Simulator is located in Xcode>Contents>Developer>Platforms>AppleTVSimulator.platform>Developer>SDKs>AppleTVSimulator.sdk>usr>include
```
Change:
```
#define __TVOS_UNAVAILABLE                    __OS_AVAILABILITY(tvos,unavailable)
#define __TVOS_PROHIBITED                     __OS_AVAILABILITY(tvos,unavailable)
```
To:
```
#define __TVOS_UNAVAILABLE_NOTQUITE                    __OS_AVAILABILITY(tvos,unavailable)
#define __TVOS_PROHIBITED_NOTQUITE                     __OS_AVAILABILITY(tvos,unavailable)
```
Do this for Availability.h for both simulator and device if you want to run it on the real hardware.
